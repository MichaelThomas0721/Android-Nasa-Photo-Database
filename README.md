# Android-Nasa-Photo-Database

I developed this app for my final project in my mobile development class.

The app lets you search the Nasa database to find satellite images given coordinates. You are able to save your favourite photos to a local database on your phone.

The app is also available in both English and French, the language will change to match your phone's lanaguage if it is set to one of those two.
